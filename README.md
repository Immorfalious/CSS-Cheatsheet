# CSS-Cheatsheet

# Description

This mini-project was designated during weel 2 of the UTSA bootcamp.
The goal was to view a website design and write code to match as closely as possible. I strongly opted to utilize grid here just to learn it's mechanics as I find it easier to learn on smaller scale.

## Deployment
